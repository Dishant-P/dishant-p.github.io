# Dishant Parikh - Portfolio Website
This website has been made by using the Remote repository by YoussefRaafatNasry. 
If at all anyone is making the same, I would suggest checking the official docs [here](https://youssefraafatnasry.github.io/portfolYOU/docs/). 
### 
All the setup and folder descriptions have been documented quite well. The only thing that you might want to change is the extra folders, like blogs and research that I have added. For the same  you may use this repository and set it the way you like.
