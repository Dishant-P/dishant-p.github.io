# Dataset Structural Index: Understanding a machine's perspective towards visual data

###### - _**Dishant Parikh**_

### Abstract
>With advances in vision and perception architectures, we have realized that working with data is equally crucial, if not more, than the algorithms. Till today, we have trained machines based on our knowledge and perspective of the world. The entire concept of Dataset Structural Index(DSI) revolves around understanding a machineâ€™s perspective of the dataset. With DSI, I show two meta values with which we can get more information over a visual dataset and use it to optimize data, create better architectures, and have an ability to guess which model would work best. These two values are the Variety contribution ratio and Similarity matrix. In the paper, I show many applications of DSI, one of which is how the same level of accuracy can be achieved with the same model architectures trained over less amount of data.

### Implications

---

DSI helps in making better decisions about the dataset choice and the model architecture to be used. DSI, when used effectively, can be a powerful tool in investigating the dataset and optimize it. DSI could be a new standard for visual datasets and a step further into data-centric approaches. The best thing about DSI is the simplicity of usage and the amount of information extracted from just two values for each class.

1. To effectively assess the dataset before detailed analysis.
2. To move around quickly from one dataset to another by getting a betterunderstanding as to which one to explore more, based on the applicationand resources available.
3. To efficiently optimize a visual dataset according to the task at hand.
4. To ease the decision-making process by giving a logical guess as to whichmodel would work best, given the DSI values.
