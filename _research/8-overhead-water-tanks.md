### Abstract
>Pattern recognition is pertinent field for detection of urban/man-made features from satellite imagery. Neural networks are best used in object detection for recognising patterns in imageries. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) become way in solving object detection task based on deep learning concepts. This article demonstrates the usability of CNNs for detecting and mapping of small objects from the urban scenes. Identification and mapping of over-head water tanks from satellite imagery is a very important task especially during reconnaissance situation raised due to water contamination. Faster Region based CNN (Faster RCNN) has been used to detect and map the overhead water tanks in the urban scene from satellite imagery. The results from this study indicate that Faster RCNN gives affirmative accuracy towards detection of small objects from satellite imageries.

### Implications

---

Faster RCNN is proven effective in extracting the small targets even with varied background. We evaluated the previously studied Faster RCNN model on dataset containing satellite images for detecting over-head water tanks. The circular pattern of the tank with the on-ground tank shadow is considered as the target object in the input image. Through transfer learning, the features of the Faster RCNN Inception-V2 model have been taken as the generalized features for the target model. Further accuracy can be improved in future by adding more images in dataset with various patterns and features of the over-head water tanks.
