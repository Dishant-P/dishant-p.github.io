### Abstract
>Convolutional networks are at the center of best in class computer vision applications for a wide assortment of undertakings. Since 2014, profound amount of work began to make better convolutional architectures, yielding generous additions in different benchmarks. Albeit expanded model size and computational cost will, in general, mean prompt quality increases for most undertakings but, the architectures now need to have some additional information to increase the performance. We show empirical evidence that with the amalgamation of content-based image similarity and deep learning models, we can provide the flow of information which can be used in making clustered learning possible. We show how parallel training of sub-dataset clusters not only reduces the cost of computation but also increases the benchmark accuracies by 5-11 percent.

### Implications

The methodology is adaptive, but still,more  work  can  be  done  in  improving  the  dynamic feature extractions as well as in reducing the error of choice. We canalso work in formalizing the way Dataset class similarity index(DCSI) is defined. The clustering algorithms can be changedand  chosen  according  to  the  way  data  is  represented.  Herewe  do  leave  the  room  for  additional  parameters  on  which the  methodology  can  be  improved,  and  comparative  analysiswith different clustering, number of clusters, and base modelarchitectures can be  performed.  There  is  still  possibility  ofimproving  the  way  the  clusters  are  formed  or  the  way  thesimilarity  is  extracted.  The  methodology,  however,  has  to  beconsidered. We wanted to drive the deep learning architecturesand  the  modern  datasets  into  the  choice  of  declaring  thesimilarity index, to have better knowledge as well as decisioncapacity of choosing the correct model for classification.

We  showed  how  the  knowledge  of  similarity  of  the  imageclasses, can be leveraged in making the model trainings betterand faster. It can also be used when the computational capacityis  low  for  a  single  thread.  The  dataset  can  be  broken  downeasily  into  clusters,  which  are  trained  individually,  and  thena rule-based system can be provided to make the appropriatemodel choice for predictions.
