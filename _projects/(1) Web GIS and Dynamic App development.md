# Web GIS and Dynamic App development portal

This project was developed under **RRSC(W), ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India**. The project was made in order to address the problem of the need of sharability and a portal for geo-infromatics researchers to showcase their work. The project was in two modules. One was the Web GIS and second being the dynamic application development portal.

The portal helps any registered user to create a flawless form based application to be used for collection of geo-spatial data in the field. Then the data uploaded from app can be viewed as a layer on the user's GIS portal.
