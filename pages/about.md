Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>
I am a Computer Science student with a deep love for Computer Vision. I love to be on both sides of the technology, research as well as development. But I am a bit biased towards research. Because the satisfaction of creating something entirely new is purely exceptional. I love to share knowledge and help others develop skills in this domain. Hence I lead the AI Club on the campus and write various educational and formal articles.
